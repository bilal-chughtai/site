    <div class="post-content">
        <p><strong>If you use Transport for London (TFL) rail services regularly, you could be saving 1/3 of the cost of your off peak rail fares by using a railcard. In the past year, this trick saved me £800. I expect it to save most people who use TFL less but still substantial amounts. Below I explain how.</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Check if you are eligible for a <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/railcards/national-railcards/">national railcard</a>. If you are between the ages of 16 and 30, you definitely are. If not, you might still be, e.g. if you are a full time mature student.</li>
<li>Buy a railcard for £35/year (sometimes multi-year railcards exist and are cheaper). You can buy directly from <a href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/railcards/national-railcards/">national rail</a> or elsewhere, e.g. on <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/trains/great-britain/railcards">trainline</a>. </li>
</ol>
<p>When you buy individual rail tickets, you can now state that you have a railcard and save 1/3 of the cost. The problem is that you don't buy individual tickets to use TFL services, and so don't get this discount by default. Here is how to enable it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stop using contactless payment. Instead, get yourself an oyster card either at a ticket machine at an underground station, or <a href="https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do">online</a>.</li>
<li>Make a journey using the oyster card. Remember what this journey was (i.e. the start and end stations, and approximate time).</li>
<li>Wait a day.</li>
<li>Register your oyster card online. You'll need to cite the journey from step 3 in order to do so.</li>
<li>Take your oyster card and your railcard to an underground station, and ask a member of underground staff to link your railcard to your oyster card. Yes, seriously - you really do have to talk to a human in real life in order to do this. Do not ask me why. </li>
</ol>
<p>Linking your railcard to your oyster card automatically grants you 1/3 off all TFL rail travel during <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares">off-peak hours</a>.</p>
<p>Some further notes:
- I expect my savings to be higher than most as my routine historically was such that I commuted off-peak in both the morning and evening, so benefited from the discount on every single journey.
- The only way to confirm your railcard is linked is to go to manually top up your oyster card at a physical ticket machine, and to check "Discounts: NR Railcard" appears in the top right. You can't check online.
- You can enable auto-top up online, so that you never have to think about topping up your oyster card.
- No, sadly you cannot add an oyster card to your google wallet or apple pay (yet). You need to use the physical card.
- Try and stick to only using the oyster card, and not switching constantly between contactless and oyster. This is because they have separate <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/capping">daily and weekly fare caps</a>.
- If all your travel during a day or week is off-peak, your <a href="https://content.tfl.gov.uk/railcard-fares.pdf">cap with a railcard</a> is significantly lower than <a href="https://content.tfl.gov.uk/adult-fares.pdf">without</a>. However, if a single journey is on-peak in some time period, the cap reverts to the regular cap.
- When your railcard expires and you replace it you will need to remember to go and re-do step 7. If you forget to do this, I have had some success emailing TFL and asking them to backdate, but they only retain 2 months of travel records, so were not able to entirely refund me.</p>
