    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I use a bunch of different apps and wearables to track various health metrics. To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cronometer.com/#diary">Cronometer</a> for logging my nutrition.</li>
<li><a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura</a> for logging my sleep and recovery metrics.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/dashboard">Strava</a> / <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/">Garmin</a> for logging my runs.</li>
<li>A Google Sheet to log my bodyweight and days I lift.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect as time goes on I'll continue to gradually accumulate health (and possibly other) data in various further services.</p>
<p>Having my data scattered across various different services was far from ideal.</p>
<ul>
<li>It meant having to check many different apps regularly to stay on top of things, which was so high friction it often meant I would just not.</li>
<li>It meant having to learn to click through many different UIs to find the information I needed.</li>
<li>It made spotting correlations and trends, especially across different services,  harder.</li>
<li>It left me beholden to the data visualisation skill and taste of various app developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted a single, consistent interface, over which I had complete control. I couldn't find an off the shelf software solution that fit my needs. I suspect none exists. The closest I found was <a href="https://exist.io/">exist.io</a> but this lacked support for some of my data, and didn't seem as flexible and future proof as building my own solution.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<hr/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So I built my own tool. It's pretty simple - it pings the APIs (or uses more cursed ways of backing data out from the less developer friendly apps...) of various services regularly, saves the data on S3, and has a frontend that can display the data in various ways. It's currently a little bit of a vibe coded mess and overfit to my use case but reach out if you're interested in using it / adding additional apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Code here: <a href="https://github.com/bilal-chughtai/health_dashboard">https://github.com/bilal-chughtai/health_dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>Frontend here: <a href="https://bilals-health-dashboard-public.streamlit.app/">https://bilals-health-dashboard-public.streamlit.app/</a> (you might need to hit "wake me up" to restart the app).</li>
</ul>

Screenshots below. All of this data is fake, thanks Claude for generating surprisingly decent synthetic data here.</p>
