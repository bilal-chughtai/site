  title: "Activation space interpretability may be doomed"
  date: 2025-01-08
  description: "There may be a fundamental problem with interpretability work that attempts to understand neural networks by decomposing their individual activation spaces in isolation: It seems likely to find features of the activations - features that help explain the statistical structure of activation spaces, rather than features of the model - the features the modelâ€™s own computations make use of."
