**[Doorframe Pullup Bar](https://amzn.eu/d/6gIDTSh)**. Easy to remove, sturdy, doesn't damage your doorframe, and elevates the bar a bit.

**Hooks**. Things should have places. This reduces clutter and saves you time when finding them. Having that place be on your wall is an efficient use of space. I use [these](https://amzn.eu/d/8c4wyXn) and [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W6SVDK7?th=1) but the exact brand is not important.

# Not products

**Duplicates of things you use often**. Okay, not an item. Owning multiple of the same item (e.g. laptop chargers, water bottles, etc) means not having to remember to take things with you (e.g. from your home to office).
