# Office

**[Varier Variable Plus](https://www.backinaction.co.uk/variable-plus-kneeling-chair-stock#tab_VariablePlusINSTOCK_VariablePlusINSTOCK_LightBrown)**. Nice chair if, like me, you can't sit still. The plus comes with a back which imo is a nice addition.

**[Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/)**. Do I even need to justify this one?

**[MX Master 3S](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/shop/p/mx-master-3s)**. Wireless mouse.

**[Keychron Q1 Max Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.keychron.uk/products/keychron-q1-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard-iso-layout-collection?variant=460778516317phyl86)**. Wireless mechanical keyboard. Solid build quality. Hotswappable switches.

**[Sony WH-1000XM6 Headphones](https://www.sony.co.uk/headphones/products/wh-1000xm6?sku=wh1000xm6s.ce7)**. Wireless noise cancelling headphones.

# Sleep

**[Oura Ring Gen 3](https://ouraring.com/)**. Sleep tracking.

**[Loop Quiet 2](https://www.loopearplugs.com/products/quiet?variant=48262905594191)**. Reusable ear plugs.

**[Manta Sleep Mask](https://mantasleep.uk/products/manta-sleep-mask)**. Darkness without the eye pressure.

**[Blue Light Blocking Glasses](https://www.blockbluelight.co.uk/products/taylor-blue-blocking-glasses-black?_psq=nightfall+taylor&_v=1.0)**. Make the entire world red for a few hours before bed to promote melatonin production. Lower quality, cheaper, and more red alternative [here](https://amzn.eu/d/0xLOevo). One advantage of the former over the latter is they offer prescription lenses. I use both.

**[Smart Coloured Light Bulbs](https://amzn.eu/d/34xoGgx)**. Buy many. Set up automations so you minimally have to manually control your lights. I recommend bright white lights during the day, and dim red lights a few hours before bed. Note I don't have strong takes on brand. I use the linked ones and they are fine, but more thought could be put into it.

# Home

**[TaoTronics AP003 Air Purifier](https://housefresh.com/taotronics-ap003-review/)**. The best affordable air purifier money... could buy in mid 2024. Unfortunately discontinued (so will be increasingly hard to find). [Better air quality is the easiest way to not die](https://dynomight.net/air/).

**[Aranet 4](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aranet4-Home-Temperature-Ink-Configuration/dp/B07YY7BH2W)**. High CO2 concentration affects productivity; this monitors it. Also monitors temperature and humidity.

**[Minirig 4](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/bluetooth-minirig-4)**. Extremely loud portable bluetooth speaker. Also with zero latency aux passthrough.

**[Google Nest Mini](https://store.google.com/gb/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-GB&selections=eyJwcm9kdWN0RmFtaWx5IjoiWjI5dloyeGxYMjVsYzNSZmJXbHVhUT09In0%3D)**. A cheapish way to start voice controlling your home. Also a decent speaker.

**Hooks**. Things should have places. This reduces clutter and saves you time when finding things. Having that place be on your wall is an efficient use of space. I use [these](https://amzn.eu/d/8c4wyXn) and [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W6SVDK7?th=1) but the exact brand is not important.

**[Squatty Potty](https://amzn.eu/d/2vn5oFb)**. Unkink your colon while you poop.

**[Doorframe Pullup Bar](https://amzn.eu/d/6gIDTSh)**. Easy to remove, sturdy, doesn't damage your doorframe, and elevates the bar a bit.

# Clothing

**[Runderwear Merino Wool Boxers](https://www.runderwear.co.uk/products/merino-boxers-multibuy-x3)**. Extremely comfy underwear that doesn't budge.

**[Darn Tough 1466 Hiking Socks](https://darntough.uk/products/mens-merino-wool-hiker-micro-crew-cushioned-midweight-hiking-socks?variant=42648726929598)**. Plush merino wool socks. Lifetime warranty.

**[Balega Running Socks](https://balega.co.uk/)**. Supportive running socks. I like 3 styles: Blister Resist, Hidden Comfort and Enduro. Here is a neat [table](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/bfdbcc99-cb4d-491f-8cf9-b4dc9c8036f6.__CR0,0,970,600_PT0_SX970_V1___.jpg) explaining the differences.

**[Uniqlo](https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/)**. Great default clothes shop.

**[Barefoot shoes](https://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/primus-lite-iii-mens-ss22?colour=Bright%20White)**. Some personal taste here, but I find them comfortable.

**[Primark Chunky Elastic Hair Ties](https://www.primark.com/en-gb/p/10pk-chunky-hair-elastics-black-991128693804)**. Cheap & strong hair ties. They do stretch out, but I tend to lose them around the time they get too loose. Buy several packs.

# Misc

**[Garmin Forerunner 165 Music](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/1611937/pn/010-02863-31)**. Entry level running watch.

# Not products

**Duplicates of things you use often**. Okay, not an item. But owning multiple of the same item means not having to remember to take things with you, e.g. from your home to your office.
