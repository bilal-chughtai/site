Here are some products I use daily and like. There are typically two processes that lead to a product making it's way onto this list:

1. Lots of research. Buying it. Using it. Liking it.
2. Some research. Buying and trying many options. Settling on one. Using it. Liking it.

# Tech

**[Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/)**. Do I even need to justify this one?

**[MX Master 3S](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/shop/p/mx-master-3s)**. Wireless mouse.

**[Keychron Q1 Max Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.keychron.uk/products/keychron-q1-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard-iso-layout-collection?variant=46077851631786)**. Wireless mechanical keyboard. Solid build quality. Hotswappable switches.

**[Minirig 4](https://minirigs.co.uk/speakers/bluetooth-minirig-4)**. Extremely loud portable bluetooth speaker. Also with zero latency aux passthrough.

**[Smart Coloured Light Bulbs](https://amzn.eu/d/34xoGgx)**. Buy many. Set up automations so you minimally have to manually control your lights. I recommend bright white lights during the day, and dim red lights a few hours before bed. Note I don't have strong takes on brand. I use the linked ones and they are fine, but more thought could be put into it.

# Clothing

**[Runderwear Merino Wool Boxers](https://www.runderwear.co.uk/products/merino-boxers-multibuy-x3)**. Extremely comfy underwear that doesn't budge.

**[Darn Tough 1466 Hiking Socks](https://darntough.uk/products/mens-merino-wool-hiker-micro-crew-cushioned-midweight-hiking-socks?variant=42648726929598)**. Plush merino wool socks. Lifetime warranty.

**[Balega Running Socks](https://balega.co.uk/)**. Supportive running socks. I like 3 styles: Blister Resist, Hidden Comfort and Enduro. Here is a neat [table](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/bfdbcc99-cb4d-491f-8cf9-b4dc9c8036f6.__CR0,0,970,600_PT0_SX970_V1___.jpg) explaining the differences.

**[Barefoot shoes](https://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/primus-lite-iii-mens-ss22?colour=Bright%20White)**. Some personal taste here, but I find them comfortable.

**[Primark Chunky Elastic Hair Ties](https://www.primark.com/en-gb/p/10pk-chunky-hair-elastics-black-991128693804)**. Cheap & strong hair ties. They do stretch out, but I tend to lose them around the time they get too loose. Buy several packs.

**[Manta Sleep Mask](https://mantasleep.uk/products/manta-sleep-mask)**. Darkness without the eye pressure.

**[Blue Light Blocking Glasses](https://www.blockbluelight.co.uk/products/taylor-blue-blocking-glasses-black?_psq=nightfall+taylor&_v=1.0)**. Make the entire world red for a few hours before bed to promote melatonin production.

**[Doorframe Pullup Bar](https://amzn.eu/d/6gIDTSh)**. Easy to remove, sturdy, doesn't damage your doorframe, and elevates the bar a bit.

**Hooks**. Things should have places. This reduces clutter and saves you time when finding things. Having that place be on your wall is an efficient use of space. I use [these](https://amzn.eu/d/8c4wyXn) and [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W6SVDK7?th=1) but the exact brand is not important.

**[Book Darts](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/n6nsPzJWurKWKk2pA/somebody-invented-a-better-bookmark)**. Better bookmarks. If in the UK buy from [here](https://theliterarygiftshop.co.uk/products/book-darts-mixed-tin?variant=43067965800678).

# Not products

**Duplicates of things you use often**. Okay, not an item. But owning multiple of the same item means not having to remember to take things with you, e.g. from your home to your office.
