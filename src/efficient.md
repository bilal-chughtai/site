When evaluating whether to invest time in making things more efficient, I often see people compare the **one off cost to make the thing more efficient** to the **expected future saved time** when using the thing. I think there is often an important third variable to track, that often swings such decisions from not worth the effort to definitely worth the effort. Namely, the **expected increase in usage** of the thing due to the **reduction in friction** of utilizing the thing. I in practice often find the final consideration to dominate.

Recent examples from my life:

- Reducing the number of button presses needed for common workflows on my laptop means I both can navigate my laptop quicker and end up navigating more instead of procrastinating navigating because it is annoying.
- Moving to a more central location in my city has meant I both save time commuting to things and also end up going to more things.
- Automating the loading of [context](/e2p) from my personal apps into AIs means I spend less time copy pasting context into AIs and also end up asking AIs more questions about my personal context.
